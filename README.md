🌾 Contract Farming with Stable Market Access


📌 Project Description

The Contract Farming with Stable Market Access system is a desktop-based application developed using Java, SQL, and Java Swing.
This project aims to empower farmers by providing them with a direct platform to connect with buyers, eliminating the need for intermediaries and middlemen.

Through this system, farmers can securely enter into contract agreements with buyers for their crops at pre-determined prices, ensuring stable market access and reducing risks of price fluctuations. The platform facilitates transparency, trust, and efficiency in agricultural trade.

Additionally, the system includes a price prediction feature, enabling farmers to forecast future crop prices and make informed decisions.

👨‍🌾 Roles

Farmers:

Register & login

Manage crop details (add, update, delete)

Publish availability for sale

Predict future prices of crops

Buyers:
